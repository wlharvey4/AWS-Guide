“Fast, highly secure and programmable content delivery network (CDN)”

[[https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/][CloudFront Home]]

[[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/index.html][CloudFront Documentation]]

[[*CloudFront Documentation][CloudFront]]

#+cindex:CloudFront
- *CloudFront* :: An AWS content delivery service that helps you improve the
                  performance, reliability, and availability of your websites
                  and applications.


#+cindex:content delivery network (CDN)
#+cindex:CDN
*Amazon CloudFront* is a fast /content delivery network/ (CDN) service that
securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally
with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly
environment.

CloudFront works seamlessly with services including AWS Shield for DDoS
mitigation, Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancing or Amazon EC2 as origins for your
applications, and =Lambda@Edge= to run custom code closer to customers’ users
and to customize the user experience.  Lastly, if you use AWS origins such as
Amazon S3, Amazon EC2 or Elastic Load Balancing, you don’t pay for any data
transferred between these services and CloudFront.

Amazon CloudFront speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web
content, such as ~.html~, ~.css~, ~.php~, image, and media files.  When users
request your content, CloudFront delivers it through a worldwide network of
edge locations that provide low latency and high performance.

*** Benefits

#+texinfo:@heading Fast & global
The Amazon CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) is massively scaled and
globally distributed.  The CloudFront network has 210 points of presence
(PoPs), and leverages the highly-resilient Amazon backbone network for superior
performance and availability for your end users.

#+texinfo:@heading Security at the Edge
Amazon CloudFront is a highly-secure CDN that provides both network and
application level protection.  Your traffic and applications benefit through a
variety of built-in protections such as AWS Shield Standard, at no additional
cost.  You can also use configurable features such as AWS Certificate Manager
(ACM) to create and manage custom SSL certificates at no extra cost.

#+texinfo:@heading Highly programmable
Amazon CloudFront features can be customized for your specific application
requirements.  =Lambda@Edge= functions, triggered by CloudFront events, extend
your custom code across AWS locations worldwide, allowing you to move even
complex application logic closer to your end users to improve responsiveness.
The CDN also supports integrations with other tools and automation interfaces
for today's DevOps and CI/CD environments by using native APIs or AWS tools.

#+texinfo:@heading Deep integration with AWS
Amazon CloudFront is integrated with AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon
EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon Route 53, and AWS Elemental Media Services.
They are all accessible via the same console and all features in the CDN can be
programmatically configured by using APIs or the AWS Management Console.

*** Content Delivery Network
*** Edge location
#+cindex:edge location
#+cindex:CloudFront, edge location
CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers
called edge locations.

*** Origin
#+cindex:origin
#+cindex:CloudFront, origin
An Amazon S3 bucket, a MediaPackage channel, or an HTTP server (for example, a
web server) that you have identified as the source for the definitive version
of your content.
*** Use Cases

#+texinfo:@heading Static asset caching
Amazon CloudFront can speed up the delivery of your static content (e.g.,
images, style sheets, JavaScript, etc.) to viewers across the globe. The
Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers a multi-tier cache by default, with
regional Edge caches that improve latency and lower the load on your origin
servers when the object is not already cached at the Edge. Caching static
content gives you the performance and scale you need to give your viewers a
fast and reliable experience when visiting your website.

#+texinfo:@heading Live & on-demand video streaming
The Amazon CloudFront CDN offers multiple options for streaming your media ---
both pre-recorded files and live events --- at sustained, high throughput
required for 4K delivery to global viewers.  For on-demand streaming, you can
use CloudFront for multi-bitrate adaptive streaming in Microsoft Smooth, HLS,
HDS, or MPEG-DASH formats to any device.  To broadcast a live stream, you can
use the Content Delivery Network to cache the media fragments at the edge and
collapse multiple requests for the manifest file to reduce load to your origin.

#+texinfo:@heading Security
CloudFront integrates seamlessly with AWS Shield for Layer 3/4 DDoS mitigation
and AWS WAF for Layer 7 protection.  In addition, CloudFront negotiates TLS
connections with the highest security ciphers, and authenticates viewers with
signed URLs.  You can also use our advanced feature Field-Level Encryption to
protect most sensitive data throughout your enterprise, so the information can
only be viewed by certain components and services in your application stack.
CloudFront also integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to
control access, with AWS CloudTrail to log access to your configuration, and
with Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) for automated certificate renewals.

#+texinfo:@heading Customizable content delivery with Lambda@@Edge
With =Lambda@Edge= you can easily run your code across AWS locations globally,
allowing you to respond to your end users at the lowest latency and allowing
you to personalize content.  For example, you can deliver unique content based
on attributes of your visitors, generate custom responses, or conduct A/B
testing with your own custom code running on the CloudFront infrastructure.

#+texinfo:@heading Dynamic content & API acceleration
Amazon CloudFront can be used to secure and accelerate your WebSocket traffic
as well as API calls.  CloudFront supports proxy methods (POST, PUT, OPTIONS,
DELETE, and PATCH) and is already integrated with Amazon API Gateway by
default.  With the Content Delivery Network (CDN), TLS connections with clients
terminate at a nearby edge location, then CloudFront uses optimized
AWS-backbone network paths to securely reach your API servers.

#+texinfo:@heading Software distribution
Amazon CloudFront scales automatically as globally-distributed clients download
software updates.  You can make your software available right at the edge where
your users are, via the content delivery network.  The CDN's high data transfer
rates speed up the delivery of your binaries, improving customer experience
while lowering your costs.

** Command Line Interface

https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

#+cindex:Command Line Interface (CLI)
#+cindex:CLI (Command Line Interface)
The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS
services.  With just one tool to download and configure, you can control
multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

The AWS CLI introduces a new set of simple file commands for efficient file
transfers to and from Amazon S3.

/Amazon Cognito/ provides authentication, authorization, and user management for
your web and mobile apps.  Your users can sign in directly with a user name and
password, or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, Google or Apple.

#+texinfo:@heading Main Components of Cognito

The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools.

#+cindex:user pools
#+cindex:identity pools
#+attr_texinfo: :indic @b
- User pools :: User pools are user directories that provide sign-up and
                sign-in options for your app users.

- Identity pools :: Identity pools enable you to grant your users access to
                    other AWS services.

*** Cross-Site Request Forgery---CSRF

https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/cross-site-request-forgery.html

#+cindex:cross-site request forgery
#+cindex:CSRF
/Cross-site Request Forgery/ happens when an attacker tricks a user into
clicking on a malicious link, where the link goes to a site where the user is
currently authenticated.

Any commands embedded in that malicious link might be executed automatically
because the user is already authenticated on the site, so the user does not see
a login screen or any other evidence of malicious activity.

In the case of Login with Amazon, Cross-site Request Forgery could be used to
mimic a client or an authentication server.

#+texinfo:@heading Use the =state= Parameter to Prevent CSRF

Login with Amazon recommends using the =state= parameter to prevent Cross-site
Request Forgery.

- The client should set the value of the =state= parameter when it initiates an
  authorization request, and save it to the user’s secure session.

- Unlike the =client_id= and =client_secret= values, in order for the =state=
  parameter to be useful in preventing attacks it should be unique, and
  non-guessable, for each and every authorization request.

  #+cindex:authorization server
- The authorization server returns the same =state= when communicating with the
  client to deliver authorization codes and access tokens .

- To protect users from attacks, the client must ignore communication if the
  returned =state= parameter doesn't match the value from the initial call.


#+texinfo:@heading Calculating the State Parameter

Clients can calculate the state parameter value in any way they choose;
however, the value should be secure from forgery.  Login with Amazon recommends
using a securely-generated random string with at least 256 bits of entropy.

#+texinfo:@subheading To calculate a state value using this method:

use a random number generator suitable for cryptographic operations.

Here is an example in Python:

#+begin_src python :eval no
def generate_state_parameter():
random = os.urandom(256)
state = base64.b64encode(random)
return (state)
#+end_src

After generating the =state= parameter value, save it to the user’s session
information, ensuring the information is communicated securely and saved to a
secure session.  When the state is returned by an authorization response,
verify the legitimacy of the user by comparing it with the state value saved to
their session.  If the values do not match, you should ignore the authorization
response.

If you’re also using the =state= parameter value to dynamically redirect users
after authentication, consider concatenating the securely-generated random
string with the dynamic URL, separated by a space, e.g. 
: state = state + " " + dynamicURL
When the authorization server returns the =state=, parse it and split it into
two values based on the space.  The second value will contain the dynamic URL
needed to direct the user to the appropriate page after authentication.

*** Field Level Encryption
*** Identity and Access Management---IAM
*** Security Credentials

#+cindex:security credentials

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html

#+cindex:authenticate
#+cindex:authorize
When you interact with AWS, you specify your AWS /security
credentials/ to verify who you are and whether you have permission to
access the resources that you are requesting.  AWS uses the /security
credentials/ to *authenticate* and *authorize* your requests.

#+begin_cartouche
For example, if you want to download a specific file from an Amazon
Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, your credentials must allow
that access. If your credentials aren't authorized to download the
file, AWS denies your request.
#+end_cartouche

**** Root User Credentials

#+cindex:root user credentials

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html

All AWS accounts have /root user credentials/ (that is, the credentials
of the account owner).  These credentials allow full access to all
resources in the account.

You cannot use policies within your account to explicitly deny access
to the root user.  You can only use an [[*Organizations Service Control Policy---SCP][AWS Organizations service
control policy (SCP)]] to limit permissions to an account, including
the root user, that is a member of an organization or organizational
unit (OU).

Because of this, we recommend that you delete your root user access
keys and then create AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user
credentials for everyday interaction with AWS.
*** Signed URLs
*** TLS
*** CloudTrail
*** Certificate Manager---ACM
** Simple Storage Service---S3
“Object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere”

https://aws.amazon.com/s3/

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that
offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and
performance.  Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so you can
organize your data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your
specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

*** S3 Access Points

“Easily manage access for shared data sets on S3”

https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/access-points/

#+cindex:access points
Access points are unique hostnames that customers create to enforce distinct
permissions and network controls for any request made through the access point.
Customers with shared data sets including data lakes, media archives, and
user-generated content can easily scale access for hundreds of applications by
creating individualized access points with names and permissions customized for
each application.  S3 Access Points is now available in all regions at no
additional cost.

** Virtual Private Cloud---VPC

“Provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch
AWS resources in a virtual network that you define”

[[https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/][VPC Home]]

[[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/][VPC Documentation]]

#+cindex:Virtual Private Cloud
#+cindex:VPC
/Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)/ lets you provision a logically
isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a
virtual network that you define.  You have complete control over your virtual
networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range,
creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.
You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC for secure and easy access to
resources and applications.

You can easily customize the network configuration of your Amazon VPC.  For
example, you can create a public-facing subnet for your web servers that have
access to the internet.  You can also place your backend systems, such as
databases or application servers, in a private-facing subnet with no internet
access.  You can use multiple layers of security, including security groups and
network access control lists, to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in
each subnet.

#+texinfo:@heading Get started with Amazon VPC

You can automatically provision AWS resources in a ready-to-use [[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html#detecting-platform][default VPC]].
Configure this VPC by adding or removing subnets, attaching network gateways,
changing the default route table, and modifying the network ACLs.

Create additional VPCs from the Amazon VPC page on the AWS Management Console
by selecting the "Start VPC Wizard" button.  You will be presented with four
basic network topologies.  Select the one that most closely resembles the
network topology that you’d like to create and click the "Create VPC" button.
You can then customize the topology further to fit your needs more closely.
Shortly after, you can start launching Amazon EC2 instances inside your VPC.

#+texinfo:@heading Benefits

#+texinfo:@subheading Secure

#+cindex:security groups
#+cindex:network access control lists
Amazon VPC provides advanced security features, such as security groups and
network access control lists, to enable inbound and outbound filtering at the
instance and subnet level.  In addition, you can store data in Amazon S3 and
restrict access so that it’s only accessible from instances inside your VPC.
For additional security, you can create dedicated instances that are physically
isolated from other AWS accounts, at the hardware level.

#+texinfo:@subheading Simple

#+cindex:AWS Management Console
Create a VPC quickly and easily using the AWS Management Console.  Select from
common network setups and find the best match for your needs.  Subnets, IP
ranges, route tables, and security groups are automatically created.  You spend
less time setting up and managing, so you can concentrate on building the
applications that run in your VPCs.

#+texinfo:@subheading Customizable

Control your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP
address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and
network gateways.  Customize the network configuration, such as by creating a
public-facing subnet for your webservers that has access to the internet, and
placing your backend systems such as databases or application servers in a
private-facing subnet with no internet access.

#+texinfo:@heading Use Cases

#+texinfo:@subheading Extend your corporate network into the cloud

#+cindex:corporate network
#+cindex:corporate firewall
Move corporate applications to the cloud, launch additional web servers, or add
more compute capacity to your network by connecting your VPC to your corporate
network.  Because your VPC can be hosted behind your corporate firewall, you
can seamlessly move your IT resources into the cloud without changing how your
users access these applications.  You can select "VPC with a Private Subnet
Only and Hardware VPN Access" from the Amazon VPC console wizard to create a
VPC that supports this use case

#+texinfo:@subheading Securely connect cloud applications to your datacenter

#+cindex:IPsec VPN
An IPsec VPN connection between your Amazon VPC and your corporate network
encrypts all communication between the application servers in the cloud and
databases in your data center.  Web servers and application servers in your VPC
can leverage Amazon EC2 elasticity and Auto Scaling features to grow and shrink
as needed.  You can create a VPC to support this use case by selecting "VPC
with Public and Private Subnets and Hardware VPN Access" in the Amazon VPC
console wizard.

#+texinfo:@subheading Out-of-band and inline traffic inspection

Amazon VPC traffic mirroring duplicates the traffic, along with full payload
data, from elastic network interfaces (ENIs) of EC2 instances, and delivers it
to out-of-band monitoring and security analysis tools.

Amazon VPC ingress routing allows you to easily deploy network and security
appliances, including third-party offerings, inline to the inbound or outbound
Amazon VPC traffic.  Inline traffic inspection helps you screen and secure
traffic to protect your workloads from malicious actors.

*** How You Set Up CloudFront to Deliver Content

#+cindex:CloudFront distribution, create
#+cindex:CloudFront, configure
#+cindex:edge server
You create a CloudFront distribution to tell CloudFront where you want content
to be delivered from, and the details about how to track and manage content
delivery.  Then CloudFront uses computers---edge servers---that are close to
your viewers to deliver that content quickly when someone wants to see it or
use it.

#+texinfo:@heading How You Configure CloudFront to Deliver Your Content

#+cindex:origin server
#+cindex:custom origin
#+cindex:edge location
1. You specify /origin servers/, like an Amazon S3 bucket or your own HTTP
   server, from which CloudFront gets your files which will then be distributed
   from CloudFront edge locations all over the world.  An /origin server/
   stores the original, definitive version of your objects.  If you're serving
   content over HTTP, your origin server is either an Amazon S3 bucket or an
   HTTP server, such as a web server.  Your HTTP server can run on an Amazon
   Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance or on a server that you manage;
   these servers are also known as /custom origins/.  If you use the Adobe
   Media Server RTMP protocol to distribute media files on demand, your origin
   server is always an Amazon S3 bucket.

   #+cindex:objects
2. You upload your files to your origin servers.  Your files, also known as
   objects, typically include web pages, images, and media files, but can be
   anything that can be served over HTTP or a supported version of Adobe RTMP,
   the protocol used by Adobe Flash Media Server.

   If you're using an Amazon S3 bucket as an origin server, you can make the
   objects in your bucket publicly readable, so that anyone who knows the
   CloudFront URLs for your objects can access them.  You also have the option
   of keeping objects private and controlling who accesses them.

3. You create a CloudFront /distribution/, which tells CloudFront which origin
   servers to get your files from when users request the files through your web
   site or application.  At the same time, you specify details such as whether
   you want CloudFront to log all requests and whether you want the
   distribution to be enabled as soon as it's created.

4. CloudFront assigns a /domain name/ to your new distribution that you can see
   in the CloudFront console, or that is returned in the response to a
   programmatic request, for example, an API request.  If you like, you can add
   an /alternate domain name/ to use instead.
   #+cindex:points of presence (POPs)
   #+cindex:POPs (points of presence)
5. CloudFront sends your distribution's configuration (but not your content) to
   all of its edge locations or points of presence (POPs)---collections of
   servers in geographically-dispersed data centers where CloudFront caches
   copies of your files.


As you develop your website or application, you use the domain name that
CloudFront provides for your URLs.  For example, if CloudFront returns
~d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net~ as the domain name for your distribution, the
URL for ~logo.jpg~ in your Amazon S3 bucket (or in the root directory on an
HTTP server) is =http://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/logo.jpg=.

Or you can set up CloudFront to use your own domain name with your
distribution.  In that case, the URL might be
=http://www.example.com/logo.jpg=.

Optionally, you can configure your origin server to add headers to the files,
to indicate how long you want the files to stay in the cache in CloudFront edge
locations.  By default, each file stays in an edge location for 24 hours before
it expires.  The minimum expiration time is 0 seconds; there isn't a maximum
expiration time limit.

*** Accessing CloudFront

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/introduction-accessing-cloudfront.html

You can access Amazon CloudFront in the following ways:

- AWS Management Console ::

     The procedures throughout this guide explain how to use the AWS Management
     Console to perform tasks.

- AWS SDKs ::

	    If you're using a programming language that AWS provides an SDK
              for, you can use an SDK to access CloudFront. SDKs simplify
              authentication, integrate easily with your development
              environment, and provide access to CloudFront commands.

- CloudFront API ::

		     If you're using a programming language that an SDK isn't
                    available for, see the [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/][Amazon CloudFront API Reference]] for
                    information about API actions and about how to make API
                    requests.

- AWS Command Line Interface ::

     For more information, see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/][Getting Set Up with the AWS Command Line
     Interface]] in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

*** Working with Distributions

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-working-with.html

#+cindex:distribution, CloudFront
#+cindex:CloudFront distribution
You create a CloudFront /distribution/ to tell CloudFront where you want
content to be delivered from, and the details about how to track and manage
content delivery.  The following topics explain some basics about CloudFront
distributions and provide detailed information about the settings you can
choose to configure your distributions to meet your business needs.

**** Creating Updating and Deleting Distributions

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-create-delete.html

You can create, update, or delete a distribution by completing the steps in the
following topics.

***** Steps for Creating a Distribution---Overview

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-creating.html

***** Creating a Distribution

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-creating-console.html

This topic is about working with distributions by using the console.

If you want to create or update a distribution by using the CloudFront API, see
[[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDistribution.html][Create Distribution]] or [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDistribution.html][Update Distribution]] in the /Amazon CloudFront API
Reference/.  When you update your distribution, be aware that a number of
additional fields are required that are not required to create a distribution.
To help make sure that all of the required fields are included when you update
your distribution by using the CloudFront API, follow the steps described in
the /Amazon CloudFront API Reference/.

***** Values That You Specify When You Create or Update a Distribution

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html

When you create a new distribution or update an existing distribution, you
specify the following values.

- Delivery Method

  - =Web= or =RTMP=
  - Unless you're using Adobe Flash Media Server with RTMP, this value is
    always =Web=.

- Origin Settings
  #+cindex:origin settings
  When you create or update a distribution, you provide information about one
  or more locations---known as origins---where you store the original versions
  of your web content.  CloudFront gets your web content from your origins and
  serves it to viewers via a world-wide network of edge servers.  Each origin
  is either an Amazon S3 bucket or an HTTP server, for example, a web server.
  #+cindex:origin domain name
  - Origin Domain Name :: The DNS domain name of the Amazon S3 bucket or HTTP
       server from which you want CloudFront to get objects for this origin.
       Choose the domain name in the Origin Domain Name field, or type the
       name.  The domain name is not case sensitive.

       If your origin is an Amazon S3 bucket, note the following:

    - If the bucket is configured as a website, enter the Amazon S3 static
      website hosting endpoint for your bucket; don't select the bucket name
      from the list in the Origin Domain Name field.

    - The files must be publicly readable unless you secure your content in
      Amazon S3 by using a CloudFront origin access identity.

  - Origin Path ::
    #+cindex:origin path
      If you want CloudFront to request your content from a directory in your
                   AWS resource or your custom origin, enter the directory
                   path, beginning with a slash (=/=).  CloudFront appends the
                   directory path to the value of Origin Domain Name, for
                   example, ~cf-origin.example.com/production/images~.  Do not
                   add a slash (=/=) at the end of the path.

  - Origin ID ::
    #+cindex:origin id
      A string that uniquely distinguishes this origin or origin group in this
                 distribution.  If you create cache behaviors in addition to
                 the default cache behavior, you use the ID that you specify
                 here to identify the origin or origin group that you want
                 CloudFront to route a request to when the request matches the
                 path pattern for that cache behavior.


The following values are for Amazon S3 origins only (except if configured as
website endpoints):

- Restrict Bucket Access
- Origin Access Identity
- Comment for New Identity
- Your Identities
- Grant Read Permissions on Bucket


The following values are for custom origins only, such as Amazon EC2, Elastic
Load Balancing, Amazon S3 buckets configured as website endpoints, or your own
web server:

- Minimum Origin SSL Protocol :: we recommend that you choose the latest TLS
     protocol that your origin supports.
- Origin Protocol Policy :: The protocol policy that you want CloudFront to use
     when fetching objects from your origin server.

  - HTTP Only :: If your origin is an Amazon S3 bucket configured as a
                 website endpoint, you must choose this option. Amazon S3
                 doesn't support HTTPS connections for website endpoints.

  - HTTPS Only :: CloudFront uses only HTTPS to access the origin.

  - Match Viewer :: CloudFront communicates with your origin using HTTP or
                    HTTPS, depending on the protocol of the viewer request.
	
- Origin Response Timeout ::
- Origin Keep-alive Timeout ::
- HTTP Port ::
- HTTPS Port ::


The following value is for all types of origins:

- Origin Custom Headers
  #+cindex:origin custom headers
  #+cindex:custom headers
  If you want CloudFront to include custom headers whenever it forwards a
  request to your origin, specify the following values:

  - Header Name
  - Value

- Cache Behavior Settings
  #+cindex:cache behavior settings
  A cache behavior lets you configure a variety of CloudFront functionality for
  a given URL path pattern for files on your website.

  When you create a new distribution, you specify settings for the default
  cache behavior, which automatically forwards all requests to the origin that
  you specify when you create the distribution.  After you create a
  distribution, you can create additional cache behaviors that define how
  CloudFront responds when it receives a request for objects that match a path
  pattern.  If you create additional cache behaviors, the default cache
  behavior is always the last to be processed.  Other cache behaviors are
  processed in the order in which they're listed in the CloudFront console or,
  if you're using the CloudFront API, the order in which they're listed in the
  DistributionConfig element for the distribution.

**** Using Different Origins

**** Using Custom URLs

“Using Custom URLs for Files by Adding Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)”

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html

#+cindex:alternate domain name (CNAME)
#+cindex:CNAME (alternate domain name)
In CloudFront, an /alternate domain name/, also known as a *CNAME*, lets you
use your own domain name (for example, =www.example.com=) for links to your
files instead of using the domain name that CloudFront assigns to your
distribution.  Both web and RTMP distributions support alternate domain names.

When you create a distribution, CloudFront returns a domain name for the
distribution, for example:

: d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net

When you use the CloudFront domain name for your files, the URL for a file
called /images/image.jpg is:

: http://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/images/image.jpg

If you want to use your own domain name, such as =www.example.com=, instead of
the cloudfront.net domain name, you can add an /alternate domain name/ to your
distribution, like =www.example.com=.  You can then use the following URL to
view ~/images/image.jpg~:

: http://www.example.com/images/image.jpg

***** Adding an Alternate Domain Name

#+cindex:alternate domain name
The following task list describes how to use the CloudFront console to add an
alternate domain name to your distribution so that you can use your own domain
name in your links instead of the CloudFront domain name.

For information about updating your distribution using the CloudFront API:
- see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-working-with.html][Working with Distributions]].


#+cindex:HTTPS, alternate domain name
If you want viewers to use HTTPS with your alternate domain name:
- see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-alternate-domain-names.html][Using Alternate Domain Names and HTTPS]].


#+texinfo:@heading Before You Begin

Make sure that you do the following before you update your distribution to add
an alternate domain name:

- Register the domain name with Route 53 or another domain provider.

- Add a certificate from an authorized certificate authority (CA) to CloudFront
  that covers the domain name you plan to use with the distribution, to
  validate that you are authorized to use the domain.


#+texinfo:@heading Adding an Alternate Domain Name

Update the following values:

#+attr_texinfo: :indic @b
- Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs) ::

     Add your alternate domain names.  Separate domain names with commas, or
     type each domain name on a new line.

- SSL Certificate (Web Distributions Only) ::

     Choose the following setting:

     *Use HTTPS*; choose *Custom SSL Certificate*, and then choose a
     certificate from the list.

- Clients Supported (Web Distributions Only) ::

     Choose an option:

  - Only Clients that Support Server Name Indication (SNI) (Recommended) ::

       Older browsers or other clients that don't support SNI must use
       another method to access your content.

  - All Clients :: CloudFront serves your HTTPS content using dedicated IP
                   addresses.  If you select this option, you incur additional
                   charges when you associate your SSL/TLS certificate with a
                   distribution that is enabled.


#+texinfo:@heading Confige the DNS Service

Configure the DNS service for the domain to route traffic for the domain, such
as ~example.com~, to the CloudFront domain name for your distribution, such as
~d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net~.

#+cindex:alias resource record set
- Route 53 :: Create an /alias resource record set/.  With an alias resource
              record set, you don't pay for Route 53 queries.  In addition, you
              can create an alias resource record set for the root domain name
              (~example.com~), which DNS doesn't allow for =CNAME=s.

	      For more information, see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html][Routing Queries to an Amazon CloudFront
              Distribution]] in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.


#+cindex:@command{dig}
#+cindex:domain information groper (dig)
Using ~dig~ or a similar tool, confirm that the resource record set that you
created in step 7 points to the domain name for your distribution.  For more
information about ~dig~, go to http://www.kloth.net/services/dig.php.

*** Serving Private Content using CloudFront

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html

Many companies that distribute content over the internet want to restrict
access to documents, business data, media streams, or content that is intended
for selected users, for example, users who have paid a fee.  To securely serve
this private content by using CloudFront, you can do the following:

#+cindex:signed URLs
#+cindex:signed cookies
- Require that your users access your private content by using special
  CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies.

  #+cindex:CloudFront URLs
- Require that your users access your content by using CloudFront URLs, not
  URLs that access content directly on the origin server (for example, Amazon
  S3 or a private HTTP server).  Requiring CloudFront URLs isn't necessary, but
  we recommend it to prevent users from bypassing the restrictions that you
  specify in signed URLs or signed cookies.

**** Overview of Serving Private Content

#+cindex:access, restrict
You can control user access to your private content in two ways, as shown in
the following illustration:

1. Restrict access to files in CloudFront edge caches

2. Restrict access to files in your origin by doing one of the following:
   #+cindex:origin access identity (OAI)
   #+cindex:OAI (origin access identity)
   - Set up an origin access identity (OAI) for your Amazon S3 bucket (unless
     you've configured it as a website endpoint)
     #+cindex:custom headers
   - Configure custom headers for a private HTTP server or an Amazon S3 bucket
     configured as a website endpoint


#+texinfo:@heading Restricting Access to Files in CloudFront Edge Caches

#+cindex:signed URLs
#+cindex:signed cookies
You can configure CloudFront to require that users access your files using
either signed URLs or signed cookies.  You then develop your application either
to create and distribute signed URLs to authenticated users or to send
Set-Cookie headers that set signed cookies on the viewers for authenticated
users.  (To give a few users long-term access to a limited number of files, you
can also create signed URLs manually.)

When you create signed URLs or signed cookies to control access to your files,
you can specify the following restrictions:

- An ending date and time, after which the URL is no longer valid.

- (Optional) The date and time that the URL becomes valid.

- (Optional) The IP address or range of addresses of the computers that can be
  used to access your content.


#+cindex:key pair
One part of a signed URL or a signed cookie is hashed and signed using the
private key from a public/private key pair.  When someone uses a signed URL or
signed cookie to access a file, CloudFront compares the signed and unsigned
portions of the URL or cookie.  If they don't match, CloudFront doesn't serve
the file.

#+cindex:RSA-SHA1
You must use RSA-SHA1 for signing URLs or cookies.  CloudFront doesn't accept
other algorithms.

#+texinfo:@heading Restricting Access to Files in Amazon S3 Buckets

#+cindex:restrict access
#+cindex:access, restrict
You can optionally secure the content in your Amazon S3 bucket so that users
can access it through CloudFront but cannot access it directly by using Amazon
S3 URLs.  This prevents someone from bypassing CloudFront and using the Amazon
S3 URL to get content that you want to restrict access to.  This step isn't
required to use signed URLs, but we recommend it.  Be aware that this option is
only available if you have not set up your Amazon S3 bucket as a website
endpoint.

To require that users access your content through CloudFront URLs, you do the
following tasks:

#+cindex:origin access identity
- Create a special CloudFront user called an *origin access identity*.

- Give the origin access identity permission to read the files in your bucket.

- Remove permission for anyone else to use Amazon S3 URLs to read the files.


For more information:

- see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html][Restricting Access to Amazon S3 Content by Using an Origin Access Identity]]


#+texinfo:@heading Restricting Access to Files on Custom Origins

#+cindex:custom headers
#+cindex:restrict access, custom headers
#+cindex:access, restrict using custom headers
If you use a custom origin, you can optionally set up custom headers to
restrict access.  For CloudFront to get your files from a custom origin, the
files must be publicly accessible.  But by using custom headers, you can
restrict access to your content so that users can access it only through
CloudFront, not directly.  This step isn't required to use signed URLs, but we
recommend it.

To require that users access content through CloudFront, change the following
settings in your CloudFront distributions:

- Origin Custom Headers :: 

     Configure CloudFront to forward custom headers to your origin.

     See [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/forward-custom-headers.html#forward-custom-headers-configure][Configuring CloudFront to Forward Custom Headers to Your Origin]].

- Viewer Protocol Policy ::

     Configure your distribution to require viewers to use HTTPS to access
     CloudFront.

     See [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesViewerProtocolPolicy][Viewer Protocol Policy]].

- Origin Protocol Policy ::

     Configure your distribution to require CloudFront to use the same protocol
     as viewers to forward requests to the origin.

     See [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginProtocolPolicy][Origin Protocol Policy]]


After you've made these changes, update your application on your custom origin
to only accept requests that include these headers.

The combination of *Viewer Protocol Policy* and *Origin Protocol Policy* ensure
that your custom headers are encrypted between the viewer and your origin.
However, we recommend that you periodically do the following to rotate the
custom headers that CloudFront forwards to your origin:.

1. Update your CloudFront distribution to begin forwarding a new header to your
   custom origin.

2. Update your application to accept the new header as confirmation that the
   request is coming from CloudFront.

3. When viewer requests no longer include the header that you're replacing,
   update your application to no longer accept the old header as confirmation
   that the request is coming from CloudFront.

**** Serving Private Content

To configure CloudFront to serve private content, do the following tasks:

1. (Optional but recommended) Require your users to access your content only
   through CloudFront.  The method that you use depends on whether you're using
   Amazon S3 or custom origins:

   - Amazon S3 ::

     See [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html][Restricting Access to Amazon S3 Content by Using an Origin Access Identity]].

   - Custom origin ::

		      See [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-overview.html#forward-custom-headers-restrict-access][Restricting Access to Files on Custom Origins]].

		      Custom origins include Amazon EC2, Amazon S3 buckets
                      configured as website endpoints, Elastic Load Balancing,
                      and your own HTTP web servers.

2. Specify the AWS accounts that you want to use to create signed URLs or
   signed cookies.

   see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html][Specifying the AWS Accounts That Can Create Signed URLs and Signed Cookies (Trusted Signers)]].

3. Write your application to respond to requests from authorized users either
   with signed URLs or with Set-Cookie headers that set signed cookies. Follow
   the steps in one of the following topics:

   - [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-signed-urls.html][Using Signed URLs]]

   - [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-signed-cookies.html][Using Signed Cookies]]

   - If you're not sure which method to use, see[[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-choosing-signed-urls-cookies.html][Choosing Between Signed URLs and Signed Cookies]].

**** Specifying Your Trusted Signers

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html

#+cindex:trusted signer
To create signed URLs or signed cookies, you need at least one AWS account that
has an active CloudFront key pair.  This account is known as a trusted signer.
The trusted signer has two purposes:

- As soon as you add the AWS account ID for your trusted signer to your
  distribution, CloudFront starts to require that users use signed URLs or
  signed cookies to access your files.
  #+cindex:private key
- When you create signed URLs or signed cookies, you use the private key from
  the trusted signer's key pair to sign a portion of the URL or the cookie.
  When someone requests a restricted file, CloudFront compares the signed
  portion of the URL or cookie with the unsigned portion to verify that the URL
  or cookie hasn't been tampered with.  CloudFront also verifies that the URL
  or cookie is valid, meaning, for example, that the expiration date and time
  hasn't passed.


When you specify trusted signers, you also indirectly specify the files that
require signed URLs or signed cookies:

- Web distributions ::

     You add trusted signers to cache behaviors.  If your distribution has only
     one cache behavior, users must use signed URLs or signed cookies to access
     any file associated with the distribution.  If you create multiple cache
     behaviors and add trusted signers to some cache behaviors and not to
     others, you can require that users use signed URLs or signed cookies to
     access some files and not others.

- RTMP distributions (signed URLs only) ::

     You add trusted signers to a distribution.  After you add trusted signers
     to an RTMP distribution, users must use signed URLs to access any file
     associated with the distribution.


*Note*: To specify trusted signers for a distribution, you must use the
CloudFront console or CloudFront API version 2009-09-09 or later.

To specify the accounts that are allowed to create signed URLs or signed
cookies and to add the accounts to your CloudFront distribution, do the
following tasks:

1. Decide which AWS accounts you want to use as trusted signers. Most
   CloudFront customers use the account that they used to create the
   distribution.

2. For each of the accounts that you selected in Step 1, create a CloudFront
   key pair.

   See [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html#private-content-creating-cloudfront-key-pairs][Creating CloudFront Key Pairs for Your Trusted Signers]].

3. If you're using .NET or Java to create signed URLs or signed cookies,
   reformat the CloudFront private key.

   see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-trusted-signers.html#private-content-reformatting-private-key][Reformatting the CloudFront Private Key (.NET and Java Only)]].

4. In the distribution for which you're creating signed URLs or signed cookies,
   specify the AWS account IDs of your trusted signers.

**** Choosing Between Signed URLs and Signed Cookies

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-choosing-signed-urls-cookies.html

CloudFront signed URLs and signed cookies provide the same basic functionality:
they allow you to control who can access your content.  If you want to serve
private content through CloudFront and you're trying to decide whether to use
signed URLs or signed cookies, consider the following.

#+texinfo:@heading Use signed URLs in the following cases:

- You want to use an RTMP distribution.  Signed cookies aren't supported for
  RTMP distributions.

- You want to restrict access to individual files, for example, an installation
  download for your application.

- Your users are using a client (for example, a custom HTTP client) that
  doesn't support cookies.


#+texinfo:@heading Use signed cookies in the following cases:

- You want to provide access to multiple restricted files, for example, all of
  the files for a video in HLS format or all of the files in the subscribers'
  area of website.

- You don't want to change your current URLs.


If you are not currently using signed URLs and if your URLs contain any of the
following query string parameters, you cannot use either signed URLs or signed
cookies:

- Expires
- Policy
- Signature
- Key-Pair-Id


CloudFront assumes that URLs that contain any of those query string parameters
are signed URLs and therefore won't look at signed cookies.

#+cindex:cloudfront api reference
This is the Amazon CloudFront API Reference.  This guide is for developers who
need detailed information about CloudFront API actions, data types, and errors.

*** s3
<<s3 API>>

#+cindex:s3 API
This section explains prominent concepts and notations in the set of high-level
S3 commands provided.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/index.html

**** Path Argument Type

#+cindex:path argument type
#+cindex:@code{LocalPath}
#+cindex:@code{S3Uri}
Whenever using a command, at least one path argument must be specified.  There
are two types of path arguments: =LocalPath= and =S3Uri=.

#+attr_texinfo: :indic @code
- LocalPath :: represents the path of a local file or directory. It can be
               written as an absolute path or relative path.

- S3Uri :: represents the location of a S3 object, prefix, or bucket.  This
           must be written in the form:
	   : s3://mybucket/mykey

**** Order of Path Arguments

Every command takes one or two positional path arguments.

- The /first path argument/ represents the *source*, which is the local
  file/directory or S3 object/prefix/bucket that is being referenced.  Commands
  with only one path argument do not have a *destination* because the operation
  is being performed only on the *source*.

- If there is a /second path argument/, it represents the *destination*, which
  is the local file/directory or S3 object/prefix/bucket that is being operated
  on.

**** Single Local File and S3 Object Operations

Some commands perform operations only on single files and S3 objects.  The
following commands are single file/object operations if no
@@texinfo:@option{--recursive}@@ flag is provided.

- cp
- mv
- rm


For this type of operation, the first path argument, the *source*, must exist
and be a local file or S3 object.  The second path argument, the *destination*,
can be the name of a local file, local directory, S3 object, S3 prefix, or S3
bucket.

The *destination* is indicated as a local directory, S3 prefix, or S3 bucket if
it ends with a forward slash or back slash.  The use of slash depends on the
path argument type.  If the path argument is a =LocalPath=, the type of slash
is the separator used by the operating system.  If the path is a =S3Uri, the
forward slash must always be used.  If a slash is at the end of the
*destination*, the destination file or object will adopt the name of the source
file or object.  Otherwise, if there is no slash at the end, the file or object
will be saved under the name provided.  See examples in ~cp~ and ~mv~ to
illustrate this description.

**** Directory and S3 Prefix Operations

Some commands only perform operations on the contents of a local directory or
S3 prefix/bucket.  Adding or omitting a forward slash or back slash to the end
of any path argument, depending on its type, does not affect the results of the
operation.  The following commands will always result in a directory or S3
prefix/bucket operation:

- sync
- mb
- rb
- ls

**** Use of Exclude and Include Filters

Currently, there is no support for the use of UNIX style wildcards in a
command's path arguments.  However, most commands have
@@texinfo:@option{--exclude "<value>"}@@ and @@texinfo:@option{--include
"<value>"} parameters that can achieve the desired result.  These parameters
perform pattern matching to either exclude or include a particular file or
object.  The following pattern symbols are supported.

#+cindex:filters
#+attr_texinfo: :indic @samp
- * :: Matches everything
 
- ? :: Matches any single character

- [sequence] :: Matches any character in sequence

- [!sequence] :: Matches any character not in sequence


Any number of these parameters can be passed to a command.  You can do this by
providing an @@texinfo:@option{--exclude}@@ or @@texinfo:@option{--include}@@
argument multiple times, e.g. @@texinfo:@samp{--include "*.txt"--include
"*.png"}@@.  When there are multiple filters, the rule is the filters that
appear later in the command take precedence over filters that appear earlier in
the command.

Each filter is evaluated against the source directory.  If the source location
is a file instead of a directory, the directory containing the file is used as
the source directory.

Note that, by default, all files are included.  This means that providing only
an @@texinfo:@option{--include}@@ filter will not change what files are
transferred.  @@texinfo:@option{--include} will only re-include files that have
been excluded from an @@texinfo:@option{--exclude}@@ filter.  If you only want
to upload files with a particular extension, you need to first exclude all
files, then re-include the files with the particular extension.

** CloudFront Developer Guide

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html

*** What CloudFront Is

#+cindex:edge location
Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static
and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your
users.  CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data
centers called /edge locations/.  When a user requests content that you're
serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides
the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best
possible performance.

#+cindex:origin
- If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency,
  CloudFront delivers it immediately.

- If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an
  /origin/ that you've defined---such as an Amazon S3 bucket, a MediaPackage
  channel, or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have
  identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.


#+cindex:latency
#+cindex:edge location
#+cindex:edge server
CloudFront speeds up the distribution of your content by routing each user
request through the AWS backbone network to the edge location that can best
serve your content.  Typically, this is a CloudFront edge server that provides
the fastest delivery to the viewer.  Using the AWS network dramatically reduces
the number of networks that your users' requests must pass through, which
improves performance.  Users get lower /latency/---the time it takes to load
the first byte of the file—and higher data transfer rates.

**** Accessing CloudFront

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/introduction-accessing-cloudfront.html

#+cindex:CloudFront, ways to access
You can access Amazon CloudFront in the following ways:

#+attr_texinfo: :indic b
- AWS Management Console :: The procedures throughout this guide explain how to
     use the AWS Management Console to perform tasks.

- AWS SDKs :: 

	      If you're using a programming language that AWS provides an SDK
              for, you can use an SDK to access CloudFront.  SDKs simplify
              authentication, integrate easily with your development
              environment, and provide access to CloudFront commands.

  - see [[https://aws.amazon.com/tools][Tools for Amazon Web Services]]

- CloudFront API ::

		    If you're using a programming language that an SDK isn't
                    available for, see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/][the Amazon CloudFront API Reference]] for
                    information about API actions and about how to make API
                    requests.

- AWS Command Line Interface ::

     For more information, see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/][Getting Set Up with the AWS Command Line
     Interface]] in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

**** How to Get Started with CloudFront

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/welcome-how-to-get-started.html

For information about getting started with Amazon CloudFront, see the following
topics in this guide:

- [[*Setting Up][Setting Up Amazon CloudFront]] :: which explains how to sign up for AWS, how to
     secure access to your AWS account, and how to set up programmatic access
     to CloudFront.

- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/GettingStarted.html][Getting Started with Amazon CloudFront]] :: which describes how to create a
     distribution that can serve content to viewers from your origin, like an
     Amazon S3 bucket or a website, and then test that it works.

**** AWS Identity and Access Management

**** CloudFront Pricing
*** Setting Up

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/setting-up-cloudfront.html

1. Sign up for AWS
2. Access Your Account
3. Create an IAM User
4. Set Up the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell

   For information about how to install and configure the AWS CLI, see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html][Getting
   Set Up with the AWS Command Line Interface]] in the AWS Command Line Interface
   User Guide.

5. Download an AWS SDK

   If you're using a programming language that AWS provides an SDK for, we
   recommend that you use an SDK instead of the Amazon CloudFront API.  The
   SDKs make authentication simpler, integrate easily with your development
   environment, and provide easy access to CloudFront commands.

   For more information, see [[https://aws.amazon.com//tools/][Tools for Amazon Web Services]]

*** Getting Started with CloudFront

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/GettingStarted.html

#+cindex:CloudFront, getting started
Get started with the basic steps to deliver your content with CloudFront by
creating a simple CloudFront distribution.

[[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/GettingStarted.SimpleDistribution.html][Getting Started with a Simple CloudFront Distribution]]

The procedures in this section show you how to use CloudFront to set up a basic
configuration that does the following:

- /Stores/ the original versions of your objects in one Amazon Simple Storage
  Service (Amazon S3) bucket
- /Distributes/ content such as text or graphics
- Makes your objects /accessible/ to everyone
- Uses the CloudFront /domain name/ in URLs for your objects (for example,
  =http://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/image.jpg=)
- Keeps your objects in CloudFront /edge locations/ for the default duration of
  24 hours (the minimum duration is 0 seconds)


Most of these options are customizable.  For example, you can store your
content on your own web server instead of using an S3 bucket, and you can limit
who has access to the content by using signed URLs or cookies.  For information
about how to customize your CloudFront distribution options, see:
- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-creating.html][Steps for Creating a Distribution (Overview)]]


You have to complete only a few basic steps to start delivering your content
with CloudFront.

- The first step is signing up.

- After that, you create a CloudFront distribution, and

- then use the CloudFront domain name in URLs in your webpages or applications
  to reference the content.

#+cindex:CloudFront getting started
#+cindex:CloudFront, simple distribution
**** Step 1---Upload Your Content to Amazon S3 and Grant Object Permissions

CloudFront can distribute almost any type of file for you using an Amazon S3
bucket as the source, and there is no limit to the amount of data that you can
store on Amazon S3.

#+cindex:private
#+cindex:permissions, grant
By default, your Amazon S3 bucket and all the files in it are private---only
the AWS account that created the bucket has read/write permission to the files.
If you want to allow anyone to access the files in your Amazon S3 bucket using
CloudFront URLs, you must grant public read permissions to the objects.  You
must explicitly grant permissions to each object in an Amazon S3 bucket.

#+cindex:private content feature
If you want to restrict who can download your content, you can use the
CloudFront private content feature.  For more information about distributing
private content:

- see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html][Serving Private Content with Signed URLs and Signed Cookies]].


***** Upload your content to Amazon S3 and grant read permissions to everyone

1. open the Amazon S3 console

2. choose *Create bucket*

3. on the Name and region page, do the following:

   - enter a bucket name

   - choose an AWS Region

4. choose *Next*

5. on the *Configure options* page, choose options for versioning, tagging, and
   other features.

6. choose *Next*

7. on the *Set permissions* page, clear the following check box:

   - *Block all public access*

     #+cindex:private content feature
     #+cindex:public read access, allow
     You must allow public read access to the bucket and files so that
     CloudFront URLs can serve content from the bucket.  However, you can
     restrict access to specific content by using the CloudFront private
     content feature.

     - see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html][Serving Private Content with Signed URLs and Signed Cookies]]

8. choose *Next*, and then choose *Create bucket*.

9. In the *Buckets* pane, choose your bucket, and then choose *Upload*.

10. choose *Add files*, and then choose the files that you want to upload.

11. choose *Next*

12. On the *Set permissions* page, grant public read privileges for each file
    that you upload to your Amazon S3 bucket.

    - choose *Next* to set permissions

    - for *Manage public permissions*, choose *Grant public read access to this
      object(s)*

    - choose *Next*

13. Set any properties that you want for the object, such as encryption or
    tagging, and then choose *Next*

14. choose *Upload*


Use your Amazon S3 URL to verify that your content is publicly accessible.

**** Step 2---Create a CloudFront Distribution

#+texinfo:@heading To create a CloudFront distribution:

1. Open the [[https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/][CloudFront console]]

2. Choose *Create Distribution*.

3. On the *Select a delivery method for your content* page, in the *Web*
   section, choose *Get Started*.

   The options are:

   - *Web* to create a web distribution for static and dynamic content, media
     file over HTTP/HTTPS, deal with objects, and serve live streaming events
     in real time;
   - *RTMP* for streaming media files using Adobe Flash Media Server's RTMP
     protocol.

4. On the *Create Distribution* page, for *Origin Domain Name*, choose the
   Amazon S3 bucket that you created earlier.  For *Origin Path*, *Origin ID*,
   *Restrict Bucket Access*, and *Origin Custom Headers*, accept the default
   values.

   - *Origin Domain Name* ::
	#+cindex:domain name, origin
	#+cindex:origin domain name
	Specify the domain name for your /origin/ --- the Amazon S3 bucket, AWS
        MediaPackage channel endpoint, AWS MediaStore container endpoint, or
        web server from which you want CloudFront to get your web content.  The
        files in your origin must be *publicly readable* if you are not using
        an OAI.

	The dropdown list contains the available AWS resources in the current
        AWS account.  To use a resource from a different AWS account, type the
        domain name of the resource.

   - *Origin Path* :: Optional.
		      #+cindex:origin path
		      If you want CloudFront to request your content from a
                      directory in your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin,
                      enter the directory name here, beginning with a =/=.  Do
                      not include a =/= at the end of the directory name.

		      CloudFront appends the directory name to the value of
                      Origin Domain Name when forwarding the request to your
                      origin.

5. Under *Default Cache Behavior Settings*, accept the default values.
   #+cindex:path pattern
   - *Path Pattern* ::

		       The default cache behavior only allows a path pattern of
                       =*= (forward all requests to the origin specified by
                       Origin).  To change the behavior or the routing for
                       other requests (for example, ~*.jpg~), add more cache
                       behaviors after you create the distribution.

     For more information about cache behavior options,

     - Cache [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesCacheBehavior][Behavior Settings]].

   - *Viewer Protocol Policy* ::

	The options are:

     - HTTP and HTTPS (default)
     - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
     - HTTP only

     If you want CloudFront to allow viewers to access your web content
     using either HTTP or HTTPS, specify *HTTP and HTTPS*.  If you want
     CloudFront to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS, specify *Redirect
     HTTP to HTTPS*. If you want CloudFront to require HTTPS, specify *HTTPS
     Only*.

6. Under *Distribution Settings*, choose the values for your distribution.

   - *Alternate Domain Names (CNAMES)* ::

	You must list any custom domain names that you use in addition to the
        CloudFront domain name for the URLs for your files.  Specify up to 100
        CNAMEs separated with commas or put each on a new line.

	You also must create a CNAME record with your DNS service to route
        queries for the custome domain to the CloudFront domain.

   - *SSL Certificate* ::

	The options are:

     - /Default CloudFront Certificate/ (~*.cloudfront.net~) --- Choose this
       option if you want your users to use HTTPS or HTTP to access your
       content with the CloudFront domain name.

     - /Custom SSL Certificate/ (~example.com~) --- Choose this option if you
       want your users to access your content by using an alternate domain
       name.  You can use a certificate stored in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
       in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.

   - *Default Root Object* :: Optional.

	The object that you want CloudFront to return (for example,
        ~index.html~) when a viewer request points to your root URL instead of
        to a specific object in your distribution.

   - *Logging* :: Select whether you want CloudFront to log all viewer requests
                  for files in your distribution.  You are charged for access
                  logs.

7. Choose *Create Distribution*.

8. After CloudFront creates your distribution, the value of the *Status* column
   for your distribution changes from *In Progress* to *Deployed*.  This
   typically takes between 20 and 40 minutes.  The domain name that CloudFront
   assigns to your distribution appears in the list of distributions.

**** Step 3---Test Your Links

After you've created your distribution, CloudFront knows where your Amazon S3
origin server is, and you know the domain name associated with the
distribution.  You can create a link to your Amazon S3 bucket content with that
domain name and have CloudFront serve it.

*** Integrate Cognito with Applications

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-integrate-apps.html

When new users discover your app, or when existing users return to it, their
first tasks are to sign up or sign in.  By integrating Amazon Cognito with your
client code, you connect your app to backend AWS functionality that aids
authentication and authorization workflows.

Your app will use the Amazon Cognito API to, for example:

- create new users in your user pool
- retrieve user pool tokens
- obtain temporary credentials from your identity pool


To integrate Amazon Cognito with your web or mobile app, use the SDKs and
libraries that the AWS Amplify framework provides.

#+texinfo:@heading Amazon Cognito Authentication With the AWS Amplify Framework

#+cindex:Amplify
/AWS Amplify/ provides *services* and *libraries* for web and mobile
developers.  With AWS Amplify, you can build apps that integrate with backend
environments that are composed of AWS services.

#+texinfo:@subheading Amplify Framework

#+cindex:Amplify framework
To provision your backend environment, and to integrate AWS services with your
client code, you use the /AWS Amplify framework/.

- The framework provides an interactive command line interface (CLI) that helps
  you configure AWS resources for features that are organized into categories,
  including analytics, storage, and authentication, among many others.

- The framework also provides high-level SDKs and libraries for web and mobile
  platforms, including iOS, Android, and JavaScript.

#+texinfo:@heading Authentication

#+cindex:authentication
Each of the SDKs and libraries include /authentication/ operations that you can
use to implement the authentication workflows that Amazon Cognito drives.

#+texinfo:@subheading Use the AWS Amplify Framework for Authentication in your App

To use the AWS Amplify framework to add authentication to your app, see the AWS
Amplify documentation for your platform:

**** AWS Amplify authentication for JavaScript

https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/authentication

#+cindex:Amplify Authentication
#+cindex:user authentication
#+cindex:authentication
#+cindex:authentication APIs
AWS Amplify Authentication module provides Authentication APIs and building
blocks for developers who want to create user authentication experiences.

Amplify interfaces with User Pools to store your user information, including
federation with other OpenID providers like Facebook & Google, and it leverages
Federated Identities to manage user access to AWS Resources, for example
allowing a user to upload a file to an S3 bucket.

The Amplify CLI automates the access control policies for these AWS resources
as well as provides fine grained access controls via GraphQL for protecting
data in your APIs.

*** Cognito APIs

**** User Pool API

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-userpools-api-reference.html

With Amazon Cognito user pools, you can enable your web and mobile app users to
sign up and sign in.

You can:

- change passwords for authenticated users

- initiate forgotten password flows for unauthenticated users


For a complete user pool API reference see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/][Amazon Cognito User Pools API
Reference]].

**** User Pool Auth API

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-userpools-server-contract-reference.html

#+cindex:authentication server
#+cindex:sign-up
#+cindex:sign-in
Once a domain has been configured for your user pool, Amazon Cognito hosts an
authentication server that allows you to add sign-up and sign-in webpages to
your app.

This section contains the HTTPS contract to the Amazon Cognito authentication
server from a user pool client, including sample requests and responses.  It
describes the expected behavior from the authentication server for positive and
negative conditions.

In addition to the server contract REST API, Amazon Cognito also provides Auth
SDKs for Android, iOS, and JavaScript that make it easier to form requests and
interact with the server.

***** AUTHORIZATION Endpoint

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authorization-endpoint.html

#+cindex:authorization endpoint
The /oauth2/authorize endpoint signs the user in.

: GET /oauth2/authorize

The ~/oauth2/authorize~ endpoint only supports HTTPS =GET=.  The user pool
client typically makes this request through a browser.  Web browsers include
Chrome or Firefox.  Android browsers include Custom Chrome Tab.  iOS browsers
include Safari View Control.

#+cindex:HTTP protocol
The authorization server requires HTTPS instead of HTTP as the protocol when
accessing the authorization endpoint.

****** Request Parameters

#+attr_texinfo: :indic @samp
- response_type :: Required

                   The response type.  Must be =code= or =token=.  Indicates
                   whether the client wants an authorization code
                   (authorization code grant flow) for the end user or directly
                   issues tokens for end user (implicit flow).

- client_id :: Required

               Must be a pre-registered client in the user pool and must be
               enabled for federation.

- redirect_uri :: Required

                  The URL to which the authentication server redirects the
                  browser after authorization has been granted by the user.  A
                  redirect URI must:

  - Be an absolute URI.
  - Be pre-registered with a client.
  - Not include a fragment component.

  Amazon Cognito requires HTTPS over HTTP except for ~http://localhost~ for
                  testing purposes only.  App callback URLs such as
                  ~myapp://example~ are also supported.

- state :: Optional but recommended

           An opaque value the clients adds to the initial request.  The
           authorization server includes this value when redirecting back to
           the client.  This value must be used by the client to prevent [[*Cross-Site Request Forgery---CSRF][CSRF]]
           attacks.

- identity_provider :: Optional

     Used by the developer to directly authenticate with a specific provider.

  - For social sign-in the valid values are Facebook, Google, and
    LoginWithAmazon.

  - For Amazon Cognito user pools, the value is =COGNITO=.

  - For other identity providers this would be the name you assigned to the IdP
    in your user pool.

- idp_identifier :: Optional

                    Used by the developer to map to a provider name without
                    exposing the provider name.

- scope :: Optional

           Can be a combination of any system-reserved scopes or custom scopes
           associated with a client.  Scopes must be separated by spaces.  Any
           scope used must be preassociated with the client or it will be
           ignored at runtime.  If the client doesn't request any scopes, the
           authentication server uses all scopes associated with the client.

           System reserved scopes are:

  - openid

    An ID token is only returned if openid scope is requested.  The access
    token can be only used against Amazon Cognito User Pools if
    aws.cognito.signin.user.admin scope is requested.  The phone, email, and
    profile scopes can only be requested if openid scope is also requested.
    These scopes dictate the claims that go inside the ID token.

  - email

  - phone

  - profile

  - aws.cognito.signin.user.admin

- code_challenge_method :: Optional

     The method used to generate the challenge.  Amazon Cognito authentication
     server supports only =S256=.

- code_challenge :: Required only when the code_challenge_method is specified.

                    The generated challenge from the code_verifier.

****** Example Requests with Positive Responses

#+end_example

#+texinfo:@heading Sample Response

#+cindex:authentication server
#+cindex:authorization code
#+cindex:state
#+cindex:query string
#+cindex:fragment
The Amazon Cognito authentication server redirects back to your app with the
authorization code and state.  The code and state must be returned in the query
string parameters and not in the fragment.

- A /query string/ :: the part of a web request that appears after a '?'
     character; the string can contain one or more parameters separated by '&'
     characters.

- A /fragment/ :: the part of a web request that appears after a '#' character
                  to specify a subsection of a document.

#+begin_example

redirect_uri=https://YOUR_APP/redirect_uri&
state=STATE&
scope=aws.cognito.signin.user.admin
#+end_example

#+texinfo:@heading Sample Response

The Amazon Cognito authorization server redirects back to your app with access
token.  Since =openid= scope was not requested, an ID token is not returned.  A
refresh token is never returned in this flow.  Token and state are returned in
the fragment and not in the query string.

#+begin_example
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://YOUR_APP/redirect_uri#access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN&token_type=bearer&expires_in=3600&state=STATE
#+end_example

******* Token grant with openid scope
#+cindex:token grant with openid scope

#+texinfo:@heading Sample Request

#+begin_example
GET https://mydomain.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize? 
response_type=token& 
client_id=ad398u21ijw3s9w3939& 
redirect_uri=https://YOUR_APP/redirect_uri& 
state=STATE&
scope=aws.cognito.signin.user.admin+openid+profile
#+end_example

#+texinfo:@heading Sample Reqponse

The authorization server redirects back to your app with access token and ID
token (because =openid= scope was included).

#+begin_example
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://YOUR_APP/redirect_ur#id_token=ID_TOKEN&access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN&token_type=bearer&expires_in=3600&state=STATE
#+end_example

****** Examples of Negative Responses

The following are examples of negative responses:

- If client_id and redirect_uri are valid but there are other problems with the
  request parameters (for example, if response_type is not included; if
  code_challenge is supplied but code_challenge_method is not supplied; or if
  code_challenge_method is not 'S256'), the authentication server redirects the
  error to client's redirect_uri.

  : HTTP 1.1 302 Found Location: https://client_redirect_uri?error=invalid_request

- If the client requests 'code' or 'token' in response_type but does not have
  permission for these requests, the Amazon Cognito authorization server should
  return unauthorized_client to client's redirect_uri, as follows:

  : HTTP 1.1 302 Found Location: https://client_redirect_uri?error=unauthorized_client

- If the client requests invalid, unknown, malformed scope, the Amazon Cognito
  authorization server should return invalid_scope to the client's
  redirect_uri, as follows:

  : HTTP 1.1 302 Found Location: https://client_redirect_uri?error=invalid_scope

- If there is any unexpected error in the server, the authentication server
  should return server_error to client's redirect_uri. It should not be the
  HTTP 500 error displayed to the end user in the browser, because this error
  doesn't get sent to the client. The following error should return:

  : HTTP 1.1 302 Found Location: https://client_redirect_uri?error=server_error

- When authenticating by federating to third-party identity providers, Cognito
  may experience connection issues such as the following:

  - If a connection timeout occurs while requesting token from the identity
    provider, the authentication server redirects the error to the client’s
    redirect_uri as follows:

    #+begin_example
    HTTP 1.1 302 Found Location: https://client_redirect_uri?
    error=invalid_request&
    error_description=Timeout+occurred+in+calling+IdP+token+endpoint
    #+end_example

  - If a connection timeout occurs while calling jwks endpoint for id_token
    validation, the authentication server redirects the error to the client’s
    redirect_uri as follows:

    #+begin_example
    HTTP 1.1 302 Found Location: https://client_redirect_uri?
    error=invalid_request&
    error_description=error_description=Timeout+in+calling+jwks+uri
    #+end_example

- When authenticating by federating to third-party identity providers, the
  providers may return error responses due to configuration errors or otherwise
  such as the following:

  - If an error response is received from other providers, the authentication
    server redirects the error to the client’s redirect_uri as follows:

    #+begin_example
    HTTP 1.1 302 Found Location: https://client_redirect_uri?
    error=invalid_request&
    error_description=[IdP name]+Error+-+[status code]+error getting token
    #+end_example

  - If an error response is received from Google, the authentication server
    redirects the error to the client’s redirect_uri as follows:

    #+begin_example
    HTTP 1.1 302 Found Location: https://client_redirect_uri?
    error=invalid_request&
    error_description=Google+Error+-+[status code]+[Google provided error code]
    #+end_example

- In the rare case where Cognito encounters an exception in the communication
  protocol while making any connection to an external identity provider, the
  authentication server redirects the error to the client's redirect_uri with
  either of the following messages:

  : HTTP 1.1 302 Found Location: https://client_redirect_uri?error=invalid_request&error_description=Connection+reset

  : HTTP 1.1 302 Found Location: https://client_redirect_uri?error=invalid_request&error_description=Read+timed+out

***** TOKEN Endpoint

***** USERINFO Endpoint

***** LOGIN Endpoint

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/login-endpoint.html

#+cindex:login endpoint
#+cindex:login webpage
The ~/login~ endpoint signs the user in.  It loads the login page and presents
the authentication options configured for the client to the user.

#+texinfo:@heading GET /login

The ~/login~ endpoint only supports HTTPS GET.  The user pool client makes this
request through a system browser.  System browsers for JavaScript include
Chrome or Firefox. Android browsers include Custom Chrome Tab. iOS browsers
include Safari View Control.

****** Request Parameters

#+attr_texinfo: :indic @samp
- client_id :: Required.  The app client ID for your app. To obtain an app
               client ID, register the app in the user pool.

- redirect_uri :: Required.  The URI where the user is redirected after a
                  successful authentication.  It should be configured on
                  =response_type= of the specified =client_id=.

- response_type :: Required.  The OAuth response type, which can be code for
                   code grant flow and token for implicit flow.

- state :: Optional but recommended.  Can be a combination of any
           system-reserved scopes or custom scopes associated with a client.
           Scopes must be separated by spaces.  If the client doesn't request
           any scopes, the authentication server uses all scopes associated
           with the client.

           System reserved scopes are: 
  - openid,

    An ID token is only returned if an =openid= scope is requested.  The access
    token can only be used against Amazon Cognito user pools if an
    =aws.cognito.signin.user.admin= scope is requested.  The =phone=, =email=,
    and =profile= scopes can only be requested if an =openid= scope is also
    requested.  These scopes dictate the claims that go inside the ID token.

  - email,

  - phone,

  - profile, and

  - aws.cognito.signin.user.admin.  

  Any scope used must be preassociated with the client or it is ignored at
           runtime.

** Login with Amazon

“Securely connect with millions of Amazon customers and personalize their
experience”

https://developer.amazon.com/apps-and-games/login-with-amazon

Let customers log in to your site or app in just a few clicks using their
Amazon accounts.  Leverage a brand customers trust while getting data like
name, email address, and zip code to build a more personalized experience.

[[https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/web-docs.html][Getting Started]]

#+texinfo:@heading Benefits

#+texinfo:@subheading Reduce registration friction
Customers prefer to register and log in with credentials they already know. In
a head-to-head test, Woot found that customers picked Login with Amazon twice
as many times as any other identity provider.

#+texinfo:@subheading Leverage security and scalability
Keep your customer information more secure by leveraging the same user
authentication system used by Amazon.com. Login with Amazon is based on OAuth
2.0, which has been broadly adopted for user-authorized exchanges across sites.

#+texinfo:@subheading Reduce infrastructure and operational cost
By taking advantage of Login with Amazon, you can spend less time building a
user management system and more time building your product. Login with Amazon
also allows for faster development cycle by using the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

#+texinfo:@subheading Make Amazon's customers your customers
When you add Amazon Pay, millions of Amazon buyers can log in and pay on your
website or mobile devices with the information already stored in their Amazon
account.

#+texinfo:@heading Blog Posts

#+texinfo:@subheading Query strings and URL fragments in Login with Amazon responses
When using an implicit grant, the Login with Amazon SDK for JavaScript can

** Build Your First Web Application

A great introduction to AWS, this tutorial teaches you how to deploy a static
website, run a web server, set up a database, authenticate users, and analyze a
clickstream.  It consists of 5 separate but related modules which can be
completed individually.

- [[https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/build-modern-app-fargate-lambda-dynamodb-python/?e=gs&p=gsrc][Build]]

** Command Line Interface---Getting Started

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html

[[https://github.com/aws/aws-cli][aws-cli GitHub Repository]]

#+cindex:Command Line Interface (CLI)
#+cindex:CLI (Command Line Interface)
The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is an open source tool that enables
you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell.

The AWS CLI is available in two versions:

- Version 1.x :: The generally available version of the AWS CLI that is
                 suitable for use in production environments.

- Version 2.x :: A preview version of the AWS CLI that is intended for testing
                 and evaluation.


With minimal configuration, the AWS CLI enables you to start running commands
that implement functionality equivalent to that provided by the browser-based
AWS Management Console from the command prompt in your favorite terminal
program:

#+cindex:@code{bash}
#+cindex:@code{zsh}
#+cindex:@code{tcsh}
#+cindex:@code{SSH}
#+attr_texinfo: :indic @b
- Linux shells :: Use common shell programs such as ~bash~, ~zsh~, and ~tcsh~
                  to run commands in Linux or macOS.

- Remotely :: Run commands on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
              instances through a remote terminal program such as PuTTY or SSH,
              or with AWS Systems Manager.


#+cindex:IaaS
All IaaS (infrastructure as a service) AWS administration, management, and
access functions in the AWS Management Console are available in the AWS API and
CLI.

The AWS CLI provides direct access to the public APIs of AWS services.  You can
explore a service's capabilities with the AWS CLI, and develop shell scripts to
manage your resources.  Or, you can take what you learn to develop programs in
other languages by using the AWS SDKs.

In addition to the low-level, API-equivalent commands, several AWS services
provide customizations for the AWS CLI.  Customizations can include
higher-level commands that simplify using a service with a complex API.  For
example, the [[s3 API][aws s3 commands]] provide a familiar syntax for managing files in
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).  Performing the same task with the
low-level commands (available under [[s3api][aws s3api]]) would take a lot more effort.

*** Installing the CLI

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html

**** CLI Version 2

AWS CLI version 2 is provided as a preview for testing and evaluation.  At this
time, we do not recommend using it in a production environment.  For production
environments, we recommend that you use the generally available version 1.x.

AWS CLI version 2 is the most recent major version of the AWS CLI and supports
all of the latest features.  Some features introduced in version 2 are not
backward compatible with version 1 and you must upgrade to access those
features.

AWS CLI version 2 is available to install only as a bundled installer.
Although you might find it in some package managers, these are not produced or
managed by AWS and are therefore not official and not supported by AWS.  We
recommend that you install the AWS CLI from only the official AWS distribution
points, as documented in this guide.

- see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html][Installing the AWS CLI version 2]].


For AWS CLI version 2, it doesn't matter if you have Python installed and if
you do, it doesn't matter which version.  AWS CLI version 2 uses only the
version of Python (and all other dependencies) that are included and installed
into a local virtual environment that is isolated.

***** Prerequisites

- The AWS CLI version 2 has no dependencies on other software packages.  It has
  a self-contained copy of all dependencies included with the installer.  You
  no longer need to have Python installed first.

- You must be able to "unzip" the downloaded package.  If your operating system
  doesn't have a built-in unzip command, use your favorite package manager to
  download it or an equivalent.

- *Linux*: We support the AWS CLI version 2 on recent distributions of CentOS,
  Fedora, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux 1, and Amazon Linux 2.

- *macOS*: We support the AWS CLI version 2 on versions of macOS that are
  supported by Apple, including High Sierra (10.13), Mojave (10.14), and
  Catalina (10.15).

***** Installing

Follow these steps from the command line to install the AWS CLI on either Linux
or macOS.  The only difference in the following commands is the name of the
file that you download.  Everything else is the same.

#+texinfo:@heading Commands for macOS

#+begin_example
curl "https://d1vvhvl2y92vvt.cloudfront.net/awscli-exe-macos.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
aws2 --version
#+end_example

: aws-cli/2.0.0dev2 Python/3.7.4 Darwin/18.7.0 botocore/2.0.0dev1

***** Upgrading

To upgrade your copy of the AWS CLI version 2, run the same steps that you used
to install it, but this time include the @@texinfo:@option{--update}@@ or
@@texinfo:@option{-u}2@ option on the install command line.  If the installer
finds an existing version of the AWS CLI version 2 in the target installation
folder and the @@texinfo:@option{--upgrade}@@ option isn't used, the install
fails.

: sudo ./aws/install --bin-dir /usr/local/bin --install-dir /usr/local/aws-cli --update

***** Uninstalling

To uninstall the AWS CLI version 2, run the following commands, substituting
the paths you used to install.

Now delete the two symlinks in the @@texinfo:@option{--bin-dir}@@ folder.  If
your user account has write permission to these folders, you don't need to use
~sudo~.

#+begin_example
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/aws2
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/aws2_completer
#+end_example

Finally, you can delete the @@texinfo:@option{--install-dir}@@ folder.  Again,
if your user account has write permission to this folder, you don't need to use
~sudo~.

: $ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/aws-cli

**** CLI Version 1

AWS CLI version 1 is the original AWS CLI, and we continue to support it.
However, major new features that are introduced in AWS CLI version 2 might not
be backported to AWS CLI version 1.  To use those features, you must install
AWS CLI version 2.

- see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv1.html][Installing the AWS CLI version 1]].


You can install the AWS CLI version 1 using any of the following techniques:

- Using a bundled installer

- Using pip

- Using a virtual environment

***** Prerequisites

- Python 2 version 2.7+ or Python 3 version 3.4+

- Windows, Linux or macOS


You can find the version number of the most recent CLI at:

- https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst


In this guide, the commands shown assume you have Python v3 installed and the
pip commands shown use the pip3 version.

***** Installing the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer

For offline or automated installations on Linux or macOS, we recommend that you
try the bundled installer.  The bundled installer includes the AWS CLI, its
dependencies, and a shell script that performs the installation for you.

- [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-bundle.html][bundled installer]]

***** Installing the AWS CLI Using pip

The pip package manager for Python provides an easy way to install, upgrade,
and remove Python packages and their dependencies.

#+texinfo:@heading Installing the current AWS CLI Version

The AWS CLI is updated frequently with support for new services and commands.
To determine whether you have the latest version:

- see the [[https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/releases][releases page on GitHub]]


If you already have pip and a supported version of Python, you can install the
AWS CLI by using the following command.  If you have Python version 3
installed, we recommend that you use the ~pip3~ command.

: $ pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user

The #+texinfo:@upgrade{--upgrade}@@ option tells ~pip3~ to upgrade any
requirements that are already installed.  The @@texinfo:@option{--user} option
tells ~pip3~ to install the program to a subdirectory of your user directory to
avoid modifying libraries used by your operating system.

#+texinfo:@heading Upgrading to the latest version of the AWS CLI

We recommend that you regularly check to see if there is a new version of the
AWS CLI and upgrade to it when you can.

Use the ~pip3 list -o~ command to check which packages are "outdated".

#+begin_example
$ aws --version
aws-cli/1.16.273 Python/3.7.3 Linux/4.14.133-113.105.amzn2.x86_64 botocore/1.13.0

$ pip3 list -o
Package    Version  Latest   Type 
---------- -------- -------- -----
awscli     1.16.170 1.16.198 wheel
botocore   1.12.160 1.12.188 wheel
#+end_example

Because the previous command shows that there is a newer version of the AWS CLI
available, you can run ~pip3 install --upgrade~ to get the latest version.

: $ pip3 install --upgrade --user awscli

#+texinfo:@heading Installing the AWS CLI in a Virtual Environment

If you encounter issues when you attempt to install the AWS CLI with ~pip3~,
you can [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-virtualenv.html][install the AWS CLI in a virtual environment]] to isolate the tool and
its dependencies.  Or you can use a different version of Python than you
normally do.

***** Steps to Take after Installation

#+texinfo:@heading Setting the Path to Include the AWS CLI

After you install the AWS CLI, you might need to add the path to the executable
file to your PATH variable.  For platform-specific instructions, see the
following topics:

- macOS :: [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-macos.html#awscli-install-osx-path][Add the AWS CLI version 1 Executable to Your macOS Command Line Path]]


Verify that the AWS CLI installed correctly by running
: $ aws --version

#+texinfo:@heading Configure the AWS CLI with Your Credentials

Before you can run a CLI command, you must configure the AWS CLI with your
credentials.

You store credential information locally by defining profiles in the [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html][AWS CLI
configuration files]], which are stored by default in your user's home directory.

- see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html][Configuring the AWS CLI]].


#+texinfo:@heading Upgrading to the Latest Version of the AWS CLI

The AWS CLI is updated regularly to add support for new services and commands.
To update to the latest version of the AWS CLI, run the installation command
again.  For details about the latest version of the AWS CLI:

- see [[https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.rst][the AWS CLI release notes]]

: $ pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user

#+texinfo:@heading Uninstalling the AWS CLI

If you need to uninstall the AWS CLI, use pip uninstall.

: $ pip3 uninstall awscli

**** TODO Install the AWS CLI version 1 on macOS

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-macos.html

The recommended way to install version 1 of the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS
CLI) on macOS is to use the bundled installer.  The bundled installer includes
all dependencies and you can use it offline.

*** Configuring the CLI

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html

This section explains how to configure the settings that the AWS Command Line
Interface (AWS CLI) uses to interact with AWS.  These include:
- your security credentials,
- the default output format, and
- the default AWS Region.


AWS requires that all incoming requests are cryptographically signed.  The AWS
CLI does this for you.  The "signature" includes a date/time stamp.  Therefore,
you must ensure that your computer's date and time are set correctly.  If you
don't, and the date/time in the signature is too far off of the date/time
recognized by the AWS service, AWS rejects the request.

**** Quickly Configuring the AWS CLI

For general use, the ~aws configure~ command is the fastest way to set up your
AWS CLI installation.  The following example shows sample values.  Replace them
with your own values as described in the following sections.

#+begin_example
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
#+end_example

When you enter this command, the AWS CLI prompts you for four pieces of
information:

- access key,
- secret access key,
- AWS Region, and
- output format.


The AWS CLI stores this information in a /profile/ (a collection of settings)
named =default=.  The information in the =default= profile is used any time you
run an AWS CLI command that doesn't explicitly specify a profile to use.

#+texinfo:@heading Access Key and Secret Access Key

The AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key are your AWS credentials.  They
are associated with an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role
that determines what permissions you have.  Access keys consist of an access
key ID and secret access key, which are used to sign programmatic requests that
you make to AWS.

#+texinfo:@heading Region

The Default region name identifies the AWS Region whose servers you want to
send your requests to by default.  This is typically the Region closest to you,
but it can be any Region.

#+texinfo:@subheading List of Available Regions

You must specify an AWS Region when using the AWS CLI, either explicitly or by
setting a default Region.  For a list of the available Regions:

#+cindex:Regions and Endpoints
- see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html][Regions and Endpoints]].


#+texinfo:@heading Output Format

The =Default output format= specifies how the results are formatted.  The value
can be any of the values in the following list.  If you don't specify an output
format, =json= is used as the default.

- json ::
- yaml ::
- text :: The output is formatted as multiple lines of tab-separated string
          values. This can be useful to pass the output to a text processor,
          like grep, sed, or awk.
- table :: The output is formatted as a table using the characters =+|-= to
           form the cell borders.  It typically presents the information in a
           "human-friendly" format that is much easier to read than the others,
           but not as programmatically useful.

**** Creating Multiple Profiles

If you use the command shown in the previous section, the result is a single
profile named =default=.  You can create additional configurations that you can
refer to with a name by specifying the @@texinfo:@option{--profile}@@ option
and assigning a name.

: $ aws configure --profile produser

Then, when you run a command, you can omit the @@texinfo:@option{--profile}
option and use the credentials and settings stored in the =default= profile.

: $ aws s3 ls

Or you can specify a @@texinfo:@option{--profile profilename}@@ and use the
credentials and settings stored under that name.

: $ aws s3 ls --profile produser

To update any of your settings, simply run ~aws configure~ again (with or
without the @@texinfo:@option{--profile} parameter, depending on which profile
you want to update) and enter new values as appropriate.  The next sections
contain more information about the files that aws configure creates, additional
settings, and named profiles.

**** Configuration Settings and Precedence

#+cindex:credential provider
The AWS CLI uses a set of /credential providers/ to look for AWS credentials.
Each credential provider looks for credentials in a different place, such as
the system or user environment variables, local AWS configuration files, or
explicitly declared on the command line as a parameter.  The AWS CLI looks for
credentials and configuration settings by invoking the providers in the
following order, stopping when it finds a set of credentials to use:

1. Command line options --- You can specify @@texinfo:@option{--region}@@,
   @@texinfo:@option{--output}@@, and @@texinfo:@option{--profile}@@ as
   parameters on the command line.

2. Environment variables --- You can store values in the environment variables:
   =AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=, =AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=, and =AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=.  If
   they are present, they are used.

3. CLI credentials file --- This is one of the files that is updated when you
   run the command ~aws configure~.  The file is located at ~/.aws/credentials
   on Linux or macOS.  This file can contain the /credential details/ for the
   =default= profile and any named profiles.

4. CLI configuration file --- This is another file that is updated when you run
   the command ~aws configure~.  The file is located at ~/.aws/config on Linux
   or macOS. This file contains the /configuration settings/ for the =default=
   profile and any named profiles.

5. Container credentials --- You can associate an IAM role with each of your
   Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task definitions.  Temporary
   credentials for that role are then available to that task's containers.

6. Instance profile credentials --- You can associate an IAM role with each of
   your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.  Temporary
   credentials for that role are then available to code running in the
   instance.  The credentials are delivered through the Amazon EC2 metadata
   service.

*** Using an IAM Role in the AWS CLI

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html

#+cindex:role
An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) /role/ is an authorization tool
that lets an IAM user gain additional (or different) permissions, or get
permissions to perform actions in a different AWS account.

You can configure the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to use an IAM role
by defining a profile for the role in the ~/.aws/credentials file.

The following example shows a role profile named marketingadmin.  If you run
commands with @@texinfo:@option{--profile marketingadmin}@@ (or specify it with
the =AWS_PROFILE= environment variable), the CLI uses the credentials defined
in the profile =user1= to assume the role with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/marketingadminrole=.  You can run any
operations that are allowed by the permissions assigned to that role.

#+begin_example
[marketingadmin]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/marketingadminrole
source_profile = user1
#+end_example

You can then specify a =source_profile= that points to a separate named profile
that contains IAM user credentials with permission to use the role.  In the
previous example, the =marketingadmin= profile uses the credentials in the
=user1= profile.  When you specify that an AWS CLI command is to use the
profile =marketingadmin=, the CLI automatically looks up the credentials for
the linked =user1= profile and uses them to request temporary credentials for
the specified IAM role.  The CLI uses the =sts:AssumeRole= operation in the
background to accomplish this.  Those temporary credentials are then used to
run the requested CLI command.  The specified role must have attached IAM
permission policies that allow the requested CLI command to run.

To run a CLI command from within an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
instance or an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) container, you can
use an IAM role attached to the instance profile or the container.  If you
specify no profile or set no environment variables, that role is used directly.
This enables you to avoid storing long-lived access keys on your instances.
You can also use those instance or container roles only to get credentials for
another role.  To do this, you use =credential_source= (instead of
=source_profile=) to specify how to find the credentials.  The
=credential_source= attribute supports the following values:

#+attr_texinfo: :indic @code
- Environment :: Retrieves the source credentials from environment variables.

- Ec2InstanceMetadata :: Uses the IAM role attached to the Amazon EC2 instance
     profile.

- EcsContainer :: Uses the IAM role attached to the Amazon ECS container.


The following example shows the same =marketingadminrole= role used by
referencing an Amazon EC2 instance profile.

#+begin_example
[profile marketingadmin]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/marketingadminrole
credential_source = Ec2InstanceMetadata
#+end_example

When you invoke a role, you have additional options that you can require, such
as the use of multi-factor authentication and an External ID (used by
third-party companies to access their clients' resources).  You can also
specify unique role session names that can be more easily audited in AWS
CloudTrail logs.

**** Configuring and Using a Role

When you run commands using a profile that specifies an IAM role, the AWS CLI
uses the source profile's credentials to call AWS Security Token Service (AWS
STS) and request temporary credentials for the specified role.  The user in the
source profile must have permission to call =sts:assume-role= for the role in
the specified profile.  The role must have a trust relationship that allows the
user in the source profile to use the role.  The process of retrieving and then
using temporary credentials for a role is often referred to as assuming the
role.

You can create a role in IAM with the permissions that you want users to assume
by following the procedure under Creating a Role to Delegate Permissions to an
IAM User in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.  If the role and
the source profile's IAM user are in the same account, you can enter your own
account ID when configuring the role's trust relationship.

After creating the role, modify the trust relationship to allow the IAM user
(or the users in the AWS account) to assume it.

The following example shows a trust policy that you could attach to a role.
This policy allows the role to be assumed by any IAM user in the account
123456789012, if the administrator of that account explicitly grants the
=sts:assumerole= permission to the user.

#+begin_example
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
#+end_example

The trust policy doesn't actually grant permissions.  The administrator of the
account must delegate the permission to assume the role to individual users by
attaching a policy with the appropriate permissions.  The following example
shows a policy that you can attach to an IAM user that allows the user to
assume only the marketingadminrole role.  For more information about granting a
user access to assume a role, see Granting a User Permission to Switch Roles in
the IAM User Guide.

#+begin_example
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/marketingadminrole"
    }
  ]
}
#+end_example

The IAM user doesn't need to have additional permissions to run the CLI
commands using the role profile.  Instead, the permissions to run the command
come from those attached to the role.  You attach permission policies to the
role to specify which actions can be performed against which AWS resources.
For more information about attaching permissions to a role (which works
identically to an IAM user), see [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html][Changing Permissions for an IAM User]] in the
IAM User Guide.

Now that you have the role profile, role permissions, role trust relationship,
and user permissions correctly configured, you can use the role at the command
line by invoking the @@texinfo:@option{--profile}@@ option.  For example, the
following calls the Amazon S3 ~ls~ command using the permissions attached to
the =marketingadmin= role as defined by the example at the beginning of this
topic.

: $ aws s3 ls --profile marketingadmin

To use the role for several calls, you can set the =AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=
environment variable for the current session from the command line.  While that
environment variable is defined, you don't have to specify the
@@texinfo:@option{--profile}@@ option on each command.

: $ export AWS_PROFILE=marketingadmin

**** Using Multi-Factor Authentication

For additional security, you can require that users provide a one-time key
generated from a multi-factor authentication (MFA) device, a U2F device, or
mobile app when they attempt to make a call using the role profile.

First, you can choose to modify the trust relationship on the IAM role to
require MFA.  This prevents anyone from using the role without first
authenticating by using MFA.  For an example, see the Condition line in the
following example.  This policy allows the IAM user named =anika= to assume the
role the policy is attached to, but only if they authenticate by using MFA.

#+begin_example
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/anika" },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": { "Bool": { "aws:multifactorAuthPresent": true } }
    }
  ]
}
#+end_example

Next, add a line to the role profile that specifies the ARN of the user's MFA
device.  The following sample config file entries show two role profiles that
both use the access keys for the IAM user anika to request temporary
credentials for the role cli-role.  The user =anika= has permissions to assume
the role, granted by the role's trust policy.

#+begin_example
[profile role-without-mfa]
region = us-west-2
role_arn= arn:aws:iam::128716708097:role/cli-role
source_profile=cli-user

[profile role-with-mfa]
region = us-west-2
role_arn= arn:aws:iam::128716708097:role/cli-role
source_profile = cli-user
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::128716708097:mfa/cli-user

[profile anika]
region = us-west-2
output = json
#+end_example

The =mfa_serial= setting can take an ARN, as shown, or the serial number of a
hardware MFA token.

The first profile, =role-without-mfa=, doesn't require MFA.  However, because
the previous example trust policy attached to the role requires MFA, any
attempt to run a command with this profile fails.

#+begin_example
$ aws iam list-users --profile role-without-mfa

An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the AssumeRole operation: Access denied
#+end_example

The second profile entry, =role-with-mfa=, identifies an MFA device to use.
When the user attempts to run a CLI command with this profile, the CLI prompts
the user to enter the one-time password (OTP) that the MFA device provides.  If
the MFA authentication succeeds, the command performs the requested operation.
The OTP is not displayed on the screen.

#+begin_example
$ aws iam list-users --profile role-with-mfa
Enter MFA code for arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/cli-user:
{
    "Users": [
        {
            ...
#+end_example

*** Using the CLI

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-using.html

**** Getting Help with the AWS CLI

You can get help with any command when using the AWS Command Line Interface
(AWS CLI).  To do so, simply type ~help~ at the end of a command name.

For example, the following command displays help for the general AWS CLI
options and the available top-level commands.

: $ aws help

The following command displays the available Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
(Amazon EC2) specific commands.

: $ aws ec2 help

The following example displays detailed help for the Amazon EC2
=DescribeInstances= operation.  The help includes descriptions of its input
parameters, available filters, and what is included as output.  It also
includes examples showing how to type common variations of the command.

: $ aws ec2 describe-instances help

** Makefile

#+texinfo:@heading Tangling

This Makefile must be tangled from within the Org buffer (as opposed to being
tangled from another Org buffer or from a batch script) because the two
functions ~get-org-fiename~ and ~get-file-version~ are elisp functions that use
the current buffer to find the filename and the current version.  The scripts
would have to be done a bit differently to make them work from an external
source.

#+texinfo:@heading Environment Variables Instead of Credentials File

For some reason when running the ~sync~ command via this Makefile, ~aws2~ was
not able to locate my credential information stored in the =~/.aws/credentials=
file created by running ~aws2 configure~.  Therefore, I placed my keys into
environment variables instead, and added the @@texinfo:@option{--region}@@
option explicitly to the command.  This solved the problem.

#+texinfo:@heading Sync Command Problem

The ~sync~ command compares files and only uploads files that have been
changed.  However, the ~makeinfo --html~ command updates every single file, not
just ones that have changed, so anytime the main Org file changes, every single
HTML file will be re-saved, thus eliminating any advantage of the ~sync~
function.
